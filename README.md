# AutoMySQLBackup
Initially cloned from https://sourceforge.net/projects/automysqlbackup/

I cloned this 3 years ago to document a change I made to address an error introduced by a change in the syntax of options for the du command. I hadn't touched this repo since. When I needed it again there were new errors which had already been fixed in the sixhop GitHub repo. You probably want to fork it like I did.
